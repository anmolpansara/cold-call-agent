 Intercontinental Commodity Exchange Dubai 2026 Cold Calling Script 

 

 Opening Hook (First 10 seconds) 

"Good [morning/afternoon] [Name], this is [Agent Name] calling from the Intercontinental Commodity Exchange Dubai. I'm reaching out because you're recognized as a leader in [agricultural commodities/sustainability/relevant sector], and I have something that could significantly impact your business in 2026. Do you have 2 minutes?" 

 

 Value Proposition (If they say yes) 

"Excellent. You're probably aware that the agricultural commodities market is undergoing massive transformation - from supply chain disruptions to new sustainability mandates. The companies that thrive are those that stay ahead of these changes through strategic connections and cutting-edge insights. 

 

That's exactly why we're hosting the 2026 Intercontinental Commodity Exchange in Dubai - the world's first truly intercontinental commodity exchange bringing together hand-picked industry leaders from 182 countries." 

 

 Key Benefits Presentation 

"Here's what makes this different from every other conference you've attended: 

 

*Exclusive Access*: We don't sell tickets to the general public. Participants are personally selected based on their industry influence and expertise - which is why you're receiving this call. 

 

*Real Business Impact*: Last year's attendees reported an average of $2.3 million in new business opportunities within 6 months of the event. This isn't just networking - it's strategic business development. 

 

*Future-Focused Content*: You'll get insider access to upcoming regulatory changes, emerging market opportunities in carbon credits and biofuels, and supply chain innovations that won't hit the mainstream for another 2-3 years." 

 

 Urgency and Scarcity 

"[Name], I'll be direct with you - we're limiting participation to ensure quality interactions. We have only 47 spots remaining for industry leaders in your sector, and we're expecting to close registration within the next 3 weeks due to demand." 

 

 Handle Common Objections 

 

 "I attend too many conferences already" 

"I completely understand, and that's exactly why this is different. Most conferences are information dumps. ICE Dubai is about transformation. You'll leave with concrete action plans, strategic partnerships, and exclusive market intelligence you can't get anywhere else. Plus, with leaders from 182 countries, you're not just expanding your network - you're globalizing your business reach." 

 

 "What's the cost?" 

"The investment varies based on participation level and specific opportunities we can customize for your company. But let me ask you this - what would it be worth to your organization to be 12-18 months ahead of your competitors on market trends? To have direct access to decision-makers from every major agricultural economy? Most of our participants tell us the ROI pays for itself with just one strategic partnership." 

 

 "I need to think about it / discuss with my team" 

"Absolutely, that's smart business. Here's what I'd suggest - let me reserve your spot for the next 48 hours while you evaluate. This way you don't lose the opportunity while you're making your decision. All I need is a yes to hold your place - no financial commitment until you're ready. Fair enough?" 

 

 "I'm not sure it's relevant to my business" 

"I appreciate that concern. Tell me, what's your biggest challenge in [their sector] right now? [Listen to response] That's exactly what our sustainability and supply chain experts will be addressing. Plus, with the new ESG requirements hitting the industry, the connections you make here could be critical for compliance and competitive advantage." 

 

 Closing Techniques 

 

 Assumptive Close 

"[Name], based on your background in [their expertise], you'd be perfect for our executive track. Should I put you down for the VIP experience package or the standard leadership participation?" 

 

 Alternative Close 

"I can see this resonating with you. Would you prefer the February 15-16 dates or the February 22-23 sessions? Both offer the same high-level content, just different timing." 

 

 Urgency Close 

"I'll be honest - I have two other calls scheduled today for the remaining spots in your sector. I'd hate for you to miss this opportunity. Can we move forward with securing your participation today?" 

 

 Final Value Reinforcement 

"Remember, this isn't just about attending another event. You're joining an exclusive community of global leaders who are literally shaping the future of agricultural commodities. The connections you make, the insights you gain, and the business opportunities you develop will compound for years to come." 

 

 Call to Action 

"Shall I get you registered today, or do you have any other questions I can address right now?"
